#### Video Demo:

**Note**: The following demo video was recorded from a Xiaomi Redmi 12, which has a screen with a height greater than that of an iPhone 13, the phone for which the page is designed. Therefore, there may be slightly awkward spaces between the bottom menu and some sections, especially on the "detail" page.
